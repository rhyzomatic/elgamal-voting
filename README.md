# elgamal-voting
Secure voting based on the ElGamal and Pedersen protocols.

Heavily based on this paper: [A Secure and Optimally Efficient Multi-Authority Election Scheme](http://www.win.tue.nl/~berry/papers/euro97.pdf).

Also borrowing a bit from this paper: [Electronic Voting Schemes](http://bezadis.ics.upjs.sk/old/files/other/rjaskova.pdf).

Added help from [this Crypto SE answer](http://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/3474/approach-towards-anonymous-e-voting/3554#3554).
